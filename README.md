# Nicole's CPSC 210 Project
## Budget/Expense Tracker

**What will the application do?** <br>
The purpose of this project is to aid the user in managing their finances. 
They will be able to track and visualize their monthly spending,
set goals, record savings, and be able to track reoccurring bills (e.g. hydro, rent, credit cards).


**Who will use it?**<br>
The target audience for this project is anyone who is in need of budget 
management and planning. I would also like to focus the implementation of this 
project to the average college/university student.


**Why is this project of interest to me?**   <br>
As a university student, being on a budget and managing my finances
is extremely important for day-to-day life. This project gives me the 
opportunity to implement something beyond just an Excel spreadsheet and 
will help me and (hopefully) other people to visualize and track their finances.
